# picture-simulation
This is a simulation that can learn and generate synthetic electronic health record data.

* The variational autoencoder is based on code from this package https://github.com/ageron/handson-ml2

* generate_data_example.ipynb shows how to generate data and save it with this package

* train_comdel_example.ipynb shows how to train the variational autoencoder

* 20200120_data_scaler.pickle is the data scaler used in the simulation

* 20200120_simulation_model_weights.h5 is the trained variational autoencoder

* 20200120_simulated_data.pickle is example simulated data
