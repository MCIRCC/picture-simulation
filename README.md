# picture-simulation
This is a simulation that can learn and generate synthetic electronic health record data.

* The variational autoencoder is based on code from this package https://github.com/ageron/handson-ml2

* generate_data_example.ipynb shows how to generate data and save it with this package

* train_comdel_example.ipynb shows how to train the variational autoencoder
